### Comic Sans Test for News Credibility

Go to your favourite news site.  
Use a browser plugin to change the entire site’s font to **Comic Sans**.

If the content instantly feels silly or impossible to take seriously, then one of two things is true:

1. **Your news source is shit**, relying on aesthetics and branding instead of substance.  
2. **You’ve been depending too much on style over substance**, mistaking the *presentation* for the *credibility*.

**Good journalism survives bad fonts.**
